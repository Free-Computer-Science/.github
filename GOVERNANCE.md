## 3. Decision-Making Process

### 3.1 Consensus-Based Approach

Our organization follows a consensus-based decision-making process. This means that all significant decisions are made after open discussion, where everyone is encouraged to share their views. The goal is to reach an agreement that reflects the input of all stakeholders.

### 3.2 Voting

In cases where consensus cannot be reached, the Core Team may call for a vote. Each Core Team member has one vote, and a simple majority is required to pass a decision. For critical decisions, such as changes to the governance structure or mission, a two-thirds majority is required.
