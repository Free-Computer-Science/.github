# INTRODUCTION

I am a former computer science educator, teaching at the high school/secondary school level. While I work as a software engineer now, and having had personal experience working with students in teaching basic, freshman level computer science to students, I never recieved a degree in computer science. As a result, I missed out on a lot of the knowledge that some in my circle of friends had and felt behind at work, despite being a fully capable and good developer. This site, much like others that exist, hope to fill in that gap completely for people who do not have the resources, time or money to go schoo, or want supplamental material to assist in their journey. Unlike OSSU or the Odin Project, is the guiding principles:

    All lessons, videos, or material used as primary material (and not recommended supplemental material) must be available for free: behind no payway, nor gatekept from learners in any way. It is recommended the lesson material be available for free, for all, with no expectation of payment, except through the goodwill of donators to the organization.
    All material will be broken up into classes, separated by lessons.
    All classes will follow Knowledge and Education standards guides, or follow a recommended form as set forth by some governing body.
    All classes will follow best practices for education by including an objective, a learning section, a doing section, extra work to support knowledge and learning, and which education standards are met.
    Classes, sections, and modules will corralate with material taught at the collegiate and university level.

By following these principles, I can create courses that:

    Effectively teach material
    Can be used by teachers and other educators in guiding their classes
    Covers the depths and breadth of general, computer science curricula

Recommended Courses by standards:

Using the 2023 Association of Computing Machinery Recommended knowledge and standards, in conjunction with reccomendations from 2013, I hope to expand and explain the following Topic Areas:

    Artificial Intelligence
    Algorithmic Foundations
    Architecture and Organization
    Data Management
    Foundations of Programming Language
    Mathematics and Statistics
    Networking and Communication
    Software Development Fundamentals
    Software Engineering
    Security
    Ethical Computer Science
    Specialized Platform Development
    System Fundamentals

## Included in this, I also want to talk about the following other areas:

    Formal Validation
    Optimization
    Introduction to ML/AI/DL
    Enterprise Development Process
