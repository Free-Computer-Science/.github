# About The Project
I did not start my CS career as a B.S. Computer Science Degree Holder. I was a Bachelors of Arts- Communications Major with an emphasis in Public Relations and a subinterest in law and theological applications of comms theory. My journey into software development and becoming an engineer was a long road, but it was paved with hand-laid bricks, step-by-step, many of which were moulded by other organizations and projects like [OSSU]() and [The Odin Project](). It helped that I became a High School Computer Science teacher early on, but so much of that knowledge had to be fought for. 

This project exists to help students and individuals in my position: Unsure of their exact direction, but know they love programming and want to continue their knowledge in the field. There is a strong difference between Computer Science as an area of study versus software development as a career interest. However, so much CS underpins what goes on in software engineering that if you don't take on at least a basic knowledge in the field, you can feel bit like a "[Software Engineer] without [a] chest" to paraphrase C.S. Lewis. I hope to slowly fill the gaps for people who had to self-learn and self-teach programming, or to provide extra knowledge and education for people struggling in their CS Majors right now.


Feel free to contribute in any way that suits your skills and abilities! I welcome your knowledge and expertise.
